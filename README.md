## Client Background

**Sample Aesthetics** operates across France and Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) with a focused portfolio of facial injectables, dermal fillers, and skincare products.  
Over 36 months (Nov 2022–Oct 2025), the company generated €20.8M through 641 clinics served by 51 sales representatives. Despite similar coverage rates, France outperforms Benelux by 4.3x in absolute revenue—revealing a targeting quality issue, not an effort problem.

### North Star Metrics
- **Coverage & Frequency**: Visits per clinic and call plan compliance  
- **Conversion Quality**: Revenue per rep visit (€1,186 France vs €467 Benelux)  
- **Market Share**: Units sold vs estimated competitor activity  
- **Rep Productivity**: Visit-to-revenue correlation (lagged)  
- **Territory Opportunity**: Clinic potential score vs realized revenue

## Executive Summary

### The Bottom Line

France generates €16.9M (4.3x Benelux) with accelerating momentum (+14% H1→H2 growth), while Benelux plateaus at €3.9M (+7.2% growth).  
**The root cause isn't market size—it's targeting precision.** Benelux has 67% coverage (similar to France's 65%), but visits convert at 2.5x lower rates.  
Fix targeting, and we unlock €148K+ annually with zero new headcount.

## Methodology & Caveats

This analysis uses **synthetic but realistic data** seeded with public anchors (ISAPS, DREES, clinic registries).  
All observed patterns mimic plausible commercial performance but do **not** represent real company data.

**Key analytical methods**  
- Growth rates: H1 vs H2 comparisons  
- Lagged regression (visit → revenue +1 month)  
- Diff-in-diff for promo impact  
- Opportunity scoring (30% potential, 50% revenue, 20% growth)  
- Gini fairness metric for incentive models  

**Caveats**  
Correlation ≠ causation.  
Event studies and pilots estimate incremental impact but retain uncertainty.  
Always validate pilots with control groups or A/B tests.
